This Python project has 3 main goals:

1 - Clean up data
This includes removing null values, converting data types, removing incorrect data, etc.

2 - Analyse via plots
I want to visually represent how different values affect the others, noting the skew and any outliers (including removing outliers)

3 - Data Pre-processing
Finally I aim to create a linear regression model using "train test split" module.
